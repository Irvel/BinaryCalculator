## Binary Calculator

This is an advanced (_atleast in theory_) binary calculator that folows the course of "Computer Organization" @ Tecnologico de Monterrey. It is the result of not finding a proper universal base conversion tool that could handle all the topics seen in the course.

It starts out with basic base conversions, then jumps into additional features such as floating point conversions and signed/unsigned numbers as was seen in class. It also features aritmetic operations in multiple bases.

Along with each conversion, I also want to include explanations on how was that result achieved, although this is a feature that might be implemented later.


### How was this made?

The interface was made using the [Foundation framework](http://github.com/zurb/foundation) and the functionality was handled with my basic knowledge of Javascript. I've yet to master Javascript, I can handle the basics but I'm still a beginner. Any pull request/ comment would be greatly appreciated.
