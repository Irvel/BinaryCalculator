Binary Calculator

This is an advanced binary calculator that folows the course of "Computer Organization" @ Tecnológico de Monterrey. 

It starts with basic decimal to binary, then jumps into other bases. It also features additional options such as floating point number conversion and signed/unsigned numbers. 

The interface was made using the Titon framework and the functionality was handled with pure Javascript.
